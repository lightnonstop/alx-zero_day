Repeated git and github project tasks:

1. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
2. Repo-session - Create a new directory called 0x01-git in your alx-pre_course repo.
3. Coding fury road - For the moment we have an empty project directory containing only a README.md. It’s time to code!
4. Collaboration is the base of a company - Isolate your work from the main code base of your project and/or from your co-workers’ work.
5. Collaboration: be up to date - Please update your file README.md in the main branch from GitHub.com. It’s the only time you are allowed to update and commit from GitHub interface.
6. HAAA what did you do??? - Please merge the branch update_script to main: “Cool, all my changes will be now part of the main branch, ready to be deployed!”
7. Never push too much - Create a .gitignore file and define a rule to never push ~ files (generated by Emacs).
